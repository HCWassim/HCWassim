Welcome to my GitHub account! I'm Wassim (@HCWassim), a third-year student at Polytech Nantes, currently pursuing studies to become a computer engineer with a focus on artificial intelligence.

My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Physics, and now I'm delving into the intricacies of computer science. Proficient in C, Java, C#, and Python, I am actively engaged in various projects. Notably, one of my recent achievements is the development of a 3D engine entirely from scratch using C. You can explore this project on my GitHub repository and watch an explanatory video on YouTube at this link: [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2y2YV7Xgo&ab_channel=wassim).
