Welcome to my GitHub account, my name is Wassim (@HCWassim) and I'm a 2nd year student at the University of Nantes enrolled in a Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science Bachelor.

I'm currently interested in research (espacially non Euclidean Geometry and Fractals) and this is why I'm programming. However I'm currently working on a Stock Manager which will soon be available for selling if you are interested!

My working language are C#, Python, Js, C++, PHP and SQL
